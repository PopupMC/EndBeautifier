### Why do I use scoreboard objectives?

Something I've learned from many years of programming is just to keep it 
simple, the goal of every programmer should be to simplify the problem
not re-invent the wheel or unesesaruly complicate it.
 
Minecraft's scoreboard is poorly named and I think everyone can
agree on that. What it really is, is an optionally managed global
variable system.

This means we can create global variables we manage or global variables
minecraft manages for us and we can reference.

I use scoreboard objectives for that reason, Minecraft already has a global
variable system baked right in for all players, there's no need to re-invent
that system with custom yml files or a database. Some servers may need to
but my server doesn't so I'm taking advantage of the oppurtunity for
simplicity.

Because it's global it also lets me insert these into holograms or use
them in other plugins very easily.

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
